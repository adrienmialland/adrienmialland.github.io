I am a passionate French researcher specializing in physiological signal processing and decision-making, with a focus on the application of artificial intelligence, informatics, and statistics in the measurement and analysis of human data. I strive to enable the development of innovative health technologies that enhance well-being and improve patient outcomes.

I earned my PhD in physiological signal processing and machine learning from the [Universit√© Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/){: target="_blank"} in France, where I conducted my research at the [Gipsa-Lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/){: target="_blank"} on the feasibility of an implantable active artificial larynx. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/){: target="_blank"}, within in the [Saito Laboratory](https://www.ytksailab.org){: target="_blank"} on biological experiments automation and protein engineering. [My work](/research){: target="_blank"} has been [published](/publications){: target="_blank"} or is soon to be released, and I later ambition to enter the French research institute [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr){: target="_blank"} to continue my research.
