I am a passionate French researcher specializing in physiological signal processing, biological data analysis, decision-making, and integrated systems. My work focuses on applying artificial intelligence, informatics, and statistics to the measurement and analysis of human data. I strive to enable the development of innovative health technologies and medical devices that enhance well-being and improve patient outcomes. I am especially interested in human functional rehabiliation though the developement of implantable active prostheses, mechatronic devices, and the analysis of their motor coupling with the body.

I earned my PhD in physiological signal processing and machine learning from the [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/){: target="_blank"} in France, where I conducted my research at the [Gipsa-Lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/){: target="_blank"} on the feasibility of an implantable active artificial larynx. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/){: target="_blank"}, within in the [Saito Laboratory](https://www.ytksailab.org){: target="_blank"} on biological experiments automation and protein engineering. [My work](/research){: target="_blank"} has been [published](/publications){: target="_blank"} or is soon to be released, and I later ambition to enter the French research institute [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr){: target="_blank"} to continue my research.
